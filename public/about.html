<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Currently residing in Europe but originally from latin america, I studied marketing but I developed profesionally in the administration area. However I was always facinated by technology but due to life circumstances I did not study something related. <br> I speak three languages</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spanish</li>
  <li>English</li>
  <li>German</li>
</ul>
<p> So the projects are not limited to only english, an advantage on this golobalized world.</p>

<p>I am a gamer since the craddle, IÂ´ve been playing games for a long time and at some point I started to get interested in how they are made. I might say that was my first approach to coding and programming.</p>

<p>Earlier I put my marketing formation to use and created some amateur websites, but always using these template sites until I decided to give it a try and learn correctly. So here I am creating my own projects from scratch, what I lack of experience I compensate with passion and the eagerness to learn. I am alwas looking for ways to expand my ideas and find areas of opportunity to improve which I think could be an advantage in this world</p>
